# DS_SolarPanel_Defect_Detection_using_DeepLearning
The primary objective is to automatically identify and classify various types of surface anomalies in solar panels to enhance maintenance efficiency and reduce energy loss. The system leverages CNN to classify solar panel images into multiple categories such as Clean, Dusty, Bird-Drop, Electrical-Damage, Physical-Damage, and Snow-Covered.
